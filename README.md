# DeepTechnicalAnalysis
Leveraging deep learning to predict next period asset returns

1. Use generate_training_data.py to generate OHLC graphs using the Gramian Angular Field Difference Transformation
2. Use train_cnn.py to train a convolutional neural network model that predicts next period returns using an OHLC graph

Improvements:
1. Use more advanced cnn architecture
2. Find specific technical patterns to use as training data
